##Project Instructions
To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

* Create index.html and styles.css files.
* Link the styles.css file to the index.html file.
* Look at the provided mockups and add the same header, titles, content and footer information into your index.html file.
* Link your navigation menu to the correct sections of the page using ID’s to link to anchor tags.
* Use appropriate HTML markup for each piece of content.
* Use the images provided for the portfolio images.
* Provide an image for your about picture to reflect the placement and sizing in the mockup.
* Create a mobile first design
 * Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document, see the project resources for links to "Using the viewport meta tag" and "Configuring the Viewport".
 * Use CSS to style your portfolio to look like the ones in the mockup.
 * Make sure your mobile design matches the mockup at 320px screen sizes.
* Add media queries to create a responsive style that matches the styles and two breakpoints provided in the mockups.
 * Match the design as it should look on a tablet device that's at least 768 pixels wide and a desktop screen size that is at least 1024px wide.
* Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account:
 * See the Workshop 'Share Your Projects With GitHub Desktop' in the Project Resources. The GitHub Desktop application can automatically create a new repository for you.
 * Make sure that you're only putting the files for this project in that repository.
* Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
  * Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
  * There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
   * Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
   * If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
   * If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.
